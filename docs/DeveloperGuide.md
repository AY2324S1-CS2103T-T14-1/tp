### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### History feature
The `history` feature allows users to access past valid commands that they made. This feature is supported by 
three classes, `CommandHistory`, `HistoryCommandParser` and `HistoryCommand`. 

#### Implementation

`CommandHistory`: This class is responsible for storing the history of valid commands that the user has entered.  
`HistoryCommandParser`: Parses the user input to create an appropriate HistoryCommand object.  
`HistoryCommand`: Executes the history command.  

After a successful user command has been executed `CommandHistory#add(input)` will be called to store the successful 
user input in the `CommandHistory`. When a user inputs a inputs a history command with the appropriate argument, the 
`AddressBookParser` will be called to produce the `HistoryCommandParser` to properly parse the input. A 
`HistoryCommand` object will be created. When the `Command#execute(model, commandHistory)` is called on the 
`HistoryCommand`, the `HistoryCommand` will call `CommandHistory#getUserCommandHistory()` to get the list of
valid user commands. `HistoryCommand` will then return a string of the appropriate number of user command that the
user has specified.

![History Command Class Diagram](images/HistoryCommandClassDiagram.png)


#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Which component should we choose to store CommandHistory:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store it under `Logic`.  
**Why:** The Logic component is responsible for command execution and parsing. 
Adding a history feature here would allow you to easily keep track of commands as they are executed.

* **Alternative 2:** Store it under `Model`.  
**Why:** The `Model` component is responsible for maintaining the state of the application. If we consider
the command history part of the application's state, it might make more sense to put it here.

**Decision:** Since the command history is only active for the duration of the application and does not need
to be saved, placing it in the `logic` component is more appropriate. If the command history need to persist
across sessions, it might be better to place it in the `model` component, as this layer is generally responsible
for data to be saved.

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sort command is facilitated by `ModelManager`. `ModelManager` contains a `SortedList<Person>` and 
`FilteredList<Person>` to provide sorting and filtering on the same list. The original list is fetched from 
`AddressBook#getPersonList()` and passed to the `FilteredList`. The `FilteredList` is then passed to the `SortedList`.
By returning the `SortedList` as an `ObservableList<Person>`, the UI will be able to update the person cards displayed
after the `find` or `sort` command has been used.

To facilitate comparing between two `Person` objects, the attributes also implement `Comparable<Person>`. The
comparators for the attributes can be used to then compare two Person on a specific attribute.

The command only allows for the sorting to be performed on one of the Person's attribute. The `SortCommandParser` will
extract the attribute, and create a `SortCommand` using the corresponding comparator for that attribute. The sequence 
diagram below illustrates how the comparator is obtained and passed to the Model to be executed.

<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should
end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

  
### Find Feature

#### Implementation

The Find feature is facilitated by the following operations:
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the filtered person list based on the Predicate<Person> given to the FindCommand object.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `find n/alex bernice` to find all employees that either contain the full word `alex` or `bernice` in their name. 
`FindCommandParser` parses the user input and creates a `FindCommand`.

Step2. Then `FindCommand` is executed, and it will call `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the filtered list in the model to only include
employees whose names contain either the full word `alex` or `bernice`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the find feature works:
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

</div>

### Edit Feature
The `edit` feature allows users to update specific information about certain employees. This feature is supported by 
three classes, `EditCommand`, `EditCommandParser` and `Model`.

#### Implementation

`EditCommand`: Stores the edited changes to be changed.<br>
`EditCommandParser`: Parses the user's edit command to create an appropriate EditCommand object.<br>
`Model`: Fetches the employee list from `Model#getSortedFilteredPersonList()` and finds the employee whose information needs to be edited.

Given below is an example usage scenario of edit command. 

Step 1: The user enters `edit 2 p/12345678` to update the phone number of the second employee in the list.<br>
`EditCommandParser` parses the user command and creates a `EditCommand`.

Step 2: `EditCommand` then gets executed. It calls `Model#setPerson()` to update the information of the chosen employee.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the edit command works: 
![EditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Increment Feature

#### Implementation

The increment feature is facilitated by the following operations:
* `Model#getSortedFilteredPersonList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns the list of employees in the filtered list.
* `Model#setPerson(target, editedPerson)`â€‰â€”â€‰Replaces the given `target` with the `editedPerson` that has the incremented salary with all other attributes of `target` unchanged.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the increment mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user has executed `find d/Marketing` to filter the employee list by the department `Marketing`.
* The `FindCommand` updates the filtered list in `Model` to contain only employees whose department is `Marketing`.

Step 2. The user executes `increment 1000` to increment the salaries of all employees in the filtered list.
The associated command `IncrementCommand` first calls `Model#getSortedFilteredPersonList()` to obtain the filtered list of persons.

Step 3. `IncrementCommand` then checks that the increment is valid for all persons in the filtered list using `IncrementCommand#checkValidIncrement(personList)`.

Step 4. For each person in the filtered list, an `editedPerson` with the incremented salary and no other details changed is constructed, before `Model#setPerson(target, editedPerson)` is called to replace the current person with the `editedPerson`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the increment feature works:
![IncrementSequenceDiagram](images/IncrementSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: When the validity of the given `increment` is checked:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Check validity before incrementing any personâ€™s salary.
  * Pros: Ensures that `increment` is valid before any modifications is made to the persons in EmployeeManager.
  * Cons: Have to loop through the filtered list twice: once to check the validity of `increment` and once to increment the salaries.

* **Alternative 2:** Check validity while incrementing each personâ€™s salary.
  * Pros: Less time required to check and increment salaries.
  * Cons: If the `increment` is invalid for a person halfway through the list, some persons would have their salaries incremented while the remaining persons would not have their salaries incremented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Clear Feature

The `clear` feature is used to clear all persons from the displayed list in EmployeeManager.

#### Proposed Implementation
When the `clear` command is executed, it will call `Model#clearSortedFilteredPersonList`.
`Model#clearSortedFilteredPersonList` will loop through the persons in the filtered list and
delete each person from the filtered list using `Model#deletePerson` until the list is cleared.
